#### Rebasing
##### Conclusion


* Should we *merge* or *rebase*?
* 2 points of view. The repositoryâ€™s commit history is:
  1. A record of what actually happened
    * Git repo is a historical document and shouldn't be tampered with
    * View of the *merge* camp
  2. The story of how your project was made
    * Idea is that you "don't publish the first edition of a book"
    * Preserve a clean history for future readers
    * View of the *rebase* camp
