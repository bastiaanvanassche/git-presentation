#### Rebasing
##### Conclusion

Best of both worlds
  1. Rebase local changes you’ve made but haven't shared yet before you push them in order to clean up your story
  2. But: never rebase anything you’ve pushed somewhere

-> This way of working is been enforced on *configuration-maps* (puppet repo) by a precommit-hook
